# What is an operating system?
An operating system is software that communicates with a computer's hardware and allows the computer to perform tasks via other software (programs).

The primary operating systems in use in personal computing are **Windows** and **Mac OS**. They are the focus of this guide.
Linux (which can be used with either Mac or PC hardware) and DOS (PC), are also operating systems, as are mobile operating systems like Android and IOS. There are also many other lesser known operating systems that have been developed and used over the years. Operating systems also have **versions** that impact compatability, such as Windows 95 vs Windows NT or Mac OS 8 vs Mac OSX.

## Operating System Compatability
In order to render files that you have extracted (via disk imaging or through local drive connection) from a piece of removable obsolete media, you must open them in a computing environment running an operating system that's compatible with the files. This _could_ be the operating system that is native to your modern computer today, (e.g. a .bitmap or .pdf created in 1995 will still open on Mac OSX), or it could very possibly require an obsolete operating system from the past. An obsolete operating system can be accessed via legacy hardware from the era of the OS, or **via [emulation](emulators.html) on modern hardware.**

**Note:** It's possible that an old file will be _viewable_ on a modern system, but will not be a faithful representation of how it rendered on the original operating system for which it was created.

### If you need to use  [emulation](emulators.html) to view your files, you will need to know the compatible operating system(s).
Look for documentation that lists the computing requirements. For example, a commercial CD-ROM would have come with a booklet or case specifying the operating system(s) on which it will run, or the disc itself could have some indication of requirements. Of course you may not still have such documentation in your possession, or more likely, the removable media was **not** commercially generated and **no** documentation ever existed.

If this is the case, you will need to make  educated guesses as to when the removable media object and its files were created, and under what circumstances (e.g. a graphic designer is more likely to have been working on a Mac than someone in finance). This process may take some trial and error.

## Here is a list of operating systems and their release dates to get you started.
