Some Markdown text with <span style="color:red">some *red* text</span>.


This is a markdown test
---
I'm not sure why that happened.
# I would think this would make a header.
So why did those dashes make bigger text?
_This shoudl be in italics_  
**And this should be bold**
and this won't be on the next liine unless I do  
this

### It would be nice to be able to make it write text on black - I need to look into that

[Let's make a link](https://www.google.com/)
