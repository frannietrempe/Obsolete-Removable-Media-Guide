# Obsolete Media Resource Guide

This guide is intended for any person or institution with a collection of obsolete removable media—including optical disks, various cartridges or floppies, or external hard disk or flash storage.  

## Removable media preservation basics:
Those disks or cartridges store digital files—possibly decades-old, depending on the format, and accessing these files can be a challenge. 

If you want to obtain the material on this media yourself, having the following components is crucial:

- Disk drive specific to your format(s)
- Cable(s) that connects your disk drive to your computer (and power cables if necessary)
- Adapters to resolve any cable connection issues
- An emulation setup to mimic the computing environment that your object needs

**File Systems**: What operating system was used to create your files? When were your files created? Knowing the file system of your removable media can be a big help in obtaining and archiving its content.  

File systems dictate how data is organized and structured on a drive, and different operating systems have used various different file systems over the years. If you try to open a floppy disk on a Mac that was originally formatted for PC use, those files will remain inaccessible.

**Note**: Unfortunately, even if you do have a functioning drive and proper connections, obtaining data from an obsolete format isn't a guarantee. Disks from years ago may suffer from any number of problems, including bit rot, loss of magnetic fields, failed circuitry, or other physical damage.

## What this guide will do:
- Help you identify your media using images and descriptions
- Provide an overview of current emulation setups and migration tactics
- Give a timeline of common operating systems and computing platforms to aid in selecting an emulator
- Suggest avenues for purchasing drives, cables, and adapters, should you wish to set up a workstation to transfer your media
- Collect and organize documentation from the archival community about preserving removable media

## What this guide _will not do_:
- Give  detailed instructions for every format or every emulation build.
- Explain the history of various removable media formats
- Address preservation of data tape

## Who might find this guide helpful?
- Archivists and librarians
- Students
- Anyone with a collection of legacy removable media!
