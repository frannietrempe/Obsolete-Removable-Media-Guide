# Obsolete Removable Media Guide

This guide is intended for any person or institution with a collection of obsolete removable media—including optical disks, various cartridges or floppies, or external hard disk or flash storage.

## Removable media preservation basics:
Those disks or cartridges store digital files—possibly decades-old, depending on the format, and accessing these files can be a challenge.

### Getting started:
- Can you connect and open your removable media on within your current computer setup? If yes, plug in the drive, insert the media, and make a [resources.html#Disk-Imaging](disk image). If not, then you will need a [media_ID.html#hardware](drive, cables, and/or adapters).
- Do you know what [operating system](operating_systems.html) your media was created on? Did the owner of your collection exclusively use a Mac or PC? Are disks labeled with any notable information?
- Do you know what [emulation build](emulators.html) is required to mimic the computing environment that your object needs?
- Is this piece of media worth investing in purchasing a drive and adapters, setting up a workstation? If not, consider a data recovery vendor.

**Keep in mind** as your begin this journey to recover the data stored on removable media in your collections:

- Do not touch the data parts with your bare hands (circuit boards, magnetic stripes, connectors, the center or underside of optical media).
- If media has a write protection/read-only mode, enable it. This might be a notch to engage or similar.
- Store upright in a cool, dry place. Remove any acidic paper inserts, separate original packaging from your removable media (though keep it if possible).
- Migrate as soon as possible; most removable media has a relatively short lifespan and is not meant for long-term storage.  

**File Systems**: What operating system was used to create your files? When were your files created? Knowing the file system of your removable media can be a big help in obtaining and archiving its content.

File systems dictate how data is organized and structured on a drive, and different operating systems have used various different file systems over the years. If you try to open a floppy disk on a Mac that was originally formatted for PC use, those files will remain inaccessible.

**Note**: Unfortunately, even if you do have a functioning drive and proper connections, obtaining data from an obsolete format isn't a guarantee. Disks from years ago may suffer from any number of problems, including bit rot, loss of magnetic fields, failed circuitry, or other physical damage.

## What this guide will do:
- Help you identify your media using images and descriptions
- Provide an overview of current emulation setups and migration tactics
- Give a timeline of common operating systems and computing platforms to aid in selecting an emulator
- Suggest avenues for purchasing drives, cables, and adapters, should you wish to set up a workstation to transfer your media
- Collect and organize documentation from the archival community about preserving removable media

## What this guide _will not do_:
- Give  detailed instructions for preserving every format or using every emulation build.
- Explain the history of various removable media formats
- Address preservation of data tape

## Who might find this guide helpful?
- Archivists and librarians
- Students
- Anyone with a collection of legacy removable media!
