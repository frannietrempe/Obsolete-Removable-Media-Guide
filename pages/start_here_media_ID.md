### Basic Preservation Workflow
What format(s) do you have in your collection?
- <a href="#optical">I have round discs</a>
- <a href="#cartridge">I have cartridges</a>
- <a href="#something-else">I have something else</a>
- <a href="#media-ID">I don't know what I have</a>
  
If you want to obtain the material on this media yourself, you will need a few components.

- Disk drive specific to your format(s)
- Cable that connects your disk drive to your computer
- Adapters to solve any cable connection issues
- An emulation setup to mimic the computing environment native to your format

<a name="cartridge"></a>
#### Cartridge-based media

### Finally...
If you decide against building a workstation yourself or only have a few objects from which to recover data, consider sending your media out to a trusted data recovery vendor.
