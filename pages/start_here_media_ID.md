### Basic Preservation Workflow
What format(s) do you have in your collection?
- <a href="#optical">I have round discs</a>
- I have cartridges
- I have something else
- I don't know what I have
  
If you want to obtain the material on this media yourself, you will need a few components.

- Disk drive specific to your format(s)
- Cable that connects your disk drive to your computer
- Adapters to solve any cable connection issues
- An emulation setup to mimic the computing environment native to your format

### Finally...
