# What is emulation?
Emulation is essentially a way of tricking a computer into running an [operating system](operating_systems.html) that it was not "meant" to run. This could mean running Mac OS 7 on a 2016 iMac that natively runs MacOS Sierra, running a Linux distribution on a Dell laptop natively running Windows 10, running Windows 95 on a modern day Mac or PC, etc.  

The idea here is that if you're trying to render old files that you retrieved from obsolete removable media (e.g. photos, documents, programs, videos, etc):  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **a)** they may not render (or render correctly) on your modern 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; computing system, and if that's the case then  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **b)** you probably don't have access to the legacy computing 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment (hardware and operating system)   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for which the files were intended.

#### The Solution to this problem is to emulate the required operating system on the computer you have.

## Selecting an emulator:
As you might imagine, there are different emulating applications for different operating systems. These applications come with varying levels of pre-configuration and compilation. The following is NOT meant to be an exhaustive list, but a jumping off point.
* #### Windows

* #### Mac OS

* #### Linux

* #### DOS

[something about browser-based emulators?]
[something about Bit Curator?]

## Putting together an emulator:
Different emulating applications will require different levels of user involvement to put them together. The documentation for the application should walk you through the process. All [is this true?] emulators require the following components and you will likely need to gather them:
* Emulating application (downloadable)
* Operating System Installer (this could be a physical object or a disk image you download)  
* ROM file (downloadable file that will mimic data contained in a read-only memory chip from a compatible piece of legacy hardware)
* Virtual hard drive (this will be created during the application configuration process)

#### Where to get operating system installers
#### Where to get ROM files
